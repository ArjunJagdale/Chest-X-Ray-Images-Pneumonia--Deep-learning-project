# Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-Ray Images

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images into categories to detect pneumonia. The model is trained and evaluated using a dataset of chest X-ray images available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset).
